            <h3>Bhagwat gita</h3>
            <p>interpretation By: RR Varma 2<br>Genre: Religious Text</p>
            <p>The Bhagwat Gita is the main sourcebook on yoga and is a concise summary of India's Vedic wisdom. Yet, remarkably, the setting for this classic spiritual text is an ancient Indian battlefield. In this interpretation of the Gita, the author explains that the essence of the Gita is the equanimity of mind, which is attained by transcending it because mind consciousness is myopic and only spiritual consciousness abounds in universal love and absolute knowledge. This best-selling and expanded edition of the most famous and popular of Indian scriptures contextualizes the book culturally and historically and explains the key concepts of Hindu religious thought and the technical vocabulary of yoga. Chapter introductions, notes and a glossary help readers understand the book's message better. Most importantly, the translation uses simple, clear language to impart the poetry, universality and timelessness of the Gita's teachings.</p>

                    <h3>Salman Rushdie</h3>
                    <p>Sir Ahmed Salman Rushdie is an Indian-born author well-known for his allegorical books that examine historical and philosophical topics through fantastical characters, somber humor, and exuberant prose. He also has gained notoriety for depicting delicate religious and political issues. 

                        In 1975, he released his debut book, Grimus. In 1981, he released Midnight’s Children, a well-read fable about contemporary India. Rushdie won the Booker Prize for this book in 1981. He also won the Booker of Bookers (1993) and the Best of the Booker (2008).
                        
                        Rushdie’s fourth book, The Satanic Verses, was met with conflicting reviews. The book contained several chapters that depicted a character based on Prophet Muhammad and portrayed him in an unflattering light. </p>

                        <h3>Amrita Pritam</h3>
                        <p>Amrita Pritam, an Indian author and poet, is regarded as the first prominent female poet and novelist of Punjabi descent in the 20th century. Her honors include the “Sahitya Akademi,” “Bharatiya Jnanpith,” and “Padma Vibhushan,” among others.

                            Born in 1919 in undivided India, Pritam experienced the horrors of the partition as a young woman, a traumatic event that profoundly affected her. 
                            
                            The sorrow, anxiety, and anguish experienced by people who witnessed the division were captured in her poetry, Ajj aakhaan Waris Shah Nu. She was inspired to write the Punjabi novel, Pinjar, which depicts the difficulties of these oppressed women because of their lack of power and discrimination during the period. </p>
